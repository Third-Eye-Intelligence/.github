# Welcome to Third Eye ðŸ‘‹


## Our Mission ðŸš€

**Probelm**: Intensive Care Units (ICUs) care for severely unwell patients, where organ failure causes 84% of deaths. It is critical to know which patients are at-risk and who can safely be discharged. ICU staff make decisions in high-pressure settings, informed by vast amounts of complex data and outdated patient risk scoring systems. These systems consider only a very basic snapshot of data, limiting both their value and use by clinicians.

**Solution**: Third Eye, an award-winning start-up from Imperial College London, has developedÂ Foresight,Â a uniquely powerful Artificial Intelligence (AI) system, that provides ICU clinicians with an early warning of when a patient will develop any organ failure.Â ForesightÂ learns from all clinical patient data, acquired both live during their hospital stay and from before admission. Proven to work on historic ICU data,Â ForesightÂ was able to predict specific, critical organ failures up to 48 hours earlier than the clinicians â€“ with 91% accuracy.
